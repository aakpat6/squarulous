Squarulous
==========

Squarulous is a simple game.
-----------------------------------

To play, you use the arrow keys. The object is to collect as many "targets" (the blue squares) by controlling the "hero" (the green square) as you can. 
Every time you capture a target, a new "obstacle" (red square) will appear. Watch out! Running into a red square will kill you. That's it!
I claim that the beauty of Squarulous lies in its absolute simplicity.

Contribution
------------
Anyone can contribute, I'm working to make Squarulous a very good square-based game. If you have any suggestions, I will also take them.

The game is made entirely in Javascript. It uses an HTML5 canvas element to draw the objects.
